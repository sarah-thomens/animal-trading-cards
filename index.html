			<p>Grey wolves, or Timber Wolves, are not solitary creatures. They live in groups called packs whose leaders are Alpha Males and Alpha Females. These packs tend to be family members, but can include outside wolves as well. Packs usually consist of 12 wolves, but there have been packs of up to 25 wolves. Female wolves can give birth to five or six cubs or pups at a time.</p>
